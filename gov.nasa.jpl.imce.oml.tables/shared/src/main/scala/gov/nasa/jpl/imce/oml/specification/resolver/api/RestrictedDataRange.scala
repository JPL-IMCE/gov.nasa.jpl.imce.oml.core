/*
 * Corresponds to an OWL2 DataRange defined in terms of some kind of restriction of some other DataRanges.
 * Instead of arbitrary OWL2 FacetRestrictionAxioms as constructors of OWL2 DataRanges,
 * the specializations of RestrictedDataRange correspond to the allowed restrictions in OWL2-DL datatype maps.
 * Node that the vocabulary of XSD fundamental facets is not included in OWL2-DL, consequently,
 * there is no support in OML for specifying datatype restrictions involving XSD fundamental facets as well.
